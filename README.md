# C++ Experiment 1: Hello World & Basic Calculator

## Aim
1. Write a C++ program to print "Hello, World!"
2. Make a simple calculator to do addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
## Objectives
🔹 Learn how a C++ program starts and works
🔹 Use 'cout' to print output and 'cin' to take input
🔹 Know why we use 'using namespace std;'.
🔹 Use of // to write comments in code for better understanding of code.
## Program Explanation
### Basic Operations and Terms used
- `#include` → Tells the computer to use input and output functions  
- `using namespace std;` → Lets us use `cout` and `cin` easily (no need to write `std::` every time)  
- `int main()` → Starting point of every C++ program  
- `return 0;` → Indicates that the program executed successfully  
- `cout` → Used to print something on the screen  
- `cin` → Used to take input from the user  
- `if-else` (conditional statements) → Helps decide what to do based on conditions (`true` / `false`)
## Program execution
1. We use cout to print: "Hello, World!"
2. Then we make a calculator:
3. We take two numbers from the user using cin
4. We do addition, subtraction, multiplication, division
5. We save each result in a variable
6. Then we print the results using cout
## What I Used
- `#include` → to add libraries  
- `cin`, `cout` → to take input and give output  
- `+`, `-`, `*`, `/` → to do math  
- `float` → to store numbers with decimals  
- `//` → to write comments  
- `if-else` → to make decisions (if needed)  
- Every statement in C++ ends with a semicolon (`;`)
## Sample Output
### 🖥️ Sample Output

```cpp
Hello World
Enter num1 :    54
Enter num_2 :   89
Sum :           143
Difference :    -35
Product :       4806
Division :      0.606742
