# C++ Experiment 1: Hello World & Basic Calculator

## Aim
1. Write a C++ program to print "Hello, World!"
2. Make a simple calculator to do addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
## Objectives
ðŸ”¹ Learn how a C++ program starts and works
ðŸ”¹ Use 'cout' to print output and 'cin' to take input
ðŸ”¹ Know why we use 'using namespace std;'.
ðŸ”¹ Use of // to write comments in code for better understanding of code.
## Program Explanation
### Basic Operations and Terms used
* #include tells the computer to use input and output functions
*using namespace std; lets us use cout and cin easily (no need to write std::everytime)
*int main() is the starting point of every C++ program.
*return 0; means the program implemented successfully.
*cout is used to print something on screen
*cin is used to take input from the user
*if-else(conditional statements) helps us decide what to do based on conditions (true/false)
## Program execution
1. We use cout to print: "Hello, World!"
2. Then we make a calculator:
3. We take two numbers from the user using cin
4. We do addition, subtraction, multiplication, division
5. We save each result in a variable
6. Then we print the results using cout
## What I Used
*#include â†’ to add libraries
*cin, cout â†’ to take input and give output
*+, -, *, / â†’ to do math
*float â†’ to store numbers with decimals
*// â†’ to write comments
*if-else â†’ to make decisions (if needed)
*Every statement in C++ ends with a semicolon (;)

## Sample Output
Hello World
Enter num1 :	54
Enter num_2 :	89
Sum :143
Difference :-35
Product :4806
Division :0.606742
